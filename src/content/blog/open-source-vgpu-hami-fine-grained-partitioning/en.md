## 1. Why Do We Need GPU Sharing / Partitioning?

Before we start, let's consider a question: Why do we need GPU sharing and partitioning solutions?

Or, to put it another way: In bare-metal environments, multiple processes can share a GPU directly—so why is this not possible in Kubernetes environments?

### Resource Awareness

First, in Kubernetes, resources are bound to nodes. For GPU resources, we use NVIDIA's device plugin for detection and reporting to the Kube-apiserver. This allows us to see the corresponding resources on the Node object.

For example:

```bash
Capacity:
  cpu:                128
  ephemeral-storage:  879000896Ki
  hugepages-1Gi:      0
  hugepages-2Mi:      0
  memory:             1056457696Ki
  nvidia.com/gpu:     8
  pods:               110
  ```

You can see that, in addition to basic cpu and memory, there is also `nvidia.com/gpu: 8`, indicating that there are 8 GPUs on this node.

### Resource Request

We can then request the corresponding resources when creating a Pod, such as requesting a GPU:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: gpu-container
    image: nvidia/cuda:11.0-base   # A GPU-enabled image
    resources:
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1          # Request 1 GPU
    command: ["nvidia-smi"]        # Example command to show GPU info
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  ```

After applying this yaml, the kube-scheduler will assign the Pod to a Node with sufficient GPU resources.

At the same time, the requested GPU resources for this Pod will be marked as used and will not be allocated to other Pods.

At this point, the answer to our question becomes clear:

- The device-plugin detects the number of physical GPUs on the node and reports it to the kube-apiserver.

- When scheduling Pods, the kube-scheduler will consume the corresponding resources based on the Pod's resource requests.

**In other words: Once GPU resources on a Node are requested by a Pod, they are marked as consumed in Kubernetes, and subsequent Pods may fail to be scheduled due to insufficient resources.**

In reality, a GPU may be powerful enough to support multiple Pods running simultaneously, but due to Kubernetes scheduling limitations, multiple Pods cannot share the GPU as expected.

Therefore, we need solutions for GPU sharing and partitioning.

Today, let's explore an open-source vGPU solution: **HAMi[1]**.

## 2. What is HAMi?

HAMi stands for **Heterogeneous AI Computing Virtualization Middleware**. Its goal is to be a virtualization platform for heterogeneous computing resources.

Currently, the most mature part is the vGPU solution for NVIDIA GPUs, so you can simply think of it as a vGPU solution.

Overall architecture:

![HAMi fine-grained GPU partitioning architecture](/images/blog/gpu1/photo3.jpg)

As you can see, there are several components involved, such as Webhook, Scheduler, Device Plugin, HAMi-Core, etc. This article focuses on usage, so the architecture and principles are briefly mentioned.

### Features

The main feature of HAMi is fine-grained GPU isolation, allowing you to isolate core and memory usage at the 1% level.

For example:

![GPU memory allocation diagram](/images/blog/gpu1/photo4.jpg)

- **nvidia.com/gpu**: Request one GPU
- **nvidia.com/gpumem**: Request 3000M GPU memory
- **nvidia.com/gpucores**: Request 30% of GPU core, meaning the Pod can only use up to 30% of the GPU's compute power

### Design

HAMi achieves GPU core and memory isolation using a vCUDA approach. The design is as follows:

![Fine-grained vGPU configuration example](/images/blog/gpu1/photo5.jpg)

HAMi rewrites the native NVIDIA CUDA driver (libvgpu.so) at the software layer, mounts it into the Pod, and intercepts CUDA APIs to enforce resource isolation and limits.

For example: The native libvgpu.so only reports CUDA OOM when GPU memory is truly exhausted. HAMi's implementation returns OOM as soon as the Pod exceeds its requested memory, enforcing resource limits.

When running the nvidia-smi command inside the Pod, only the resources requested in the Pod's Resource spec are shown, achieving isolation at the monitoring level as well.

ps: Some CUDA and NVML APIs need to be intercepted.

## 3. HAMi Feature Overview

HAMi provides a Helm Chart for easy installation.

### Deploy GPU Operator

HAMi depends on NVIDIA's stack, so it's recommended to deploy GPU Operator first.

After deploying GPU Operator, deploy HAMi.

### Deploy HAMi

First, add the HAMi Helm repo:

```bash
helm repo add hami-charts https://project-hami.github.io/HAMi/
```

Next, get your cluster server version:

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f0f0f0; margin: 10px 0;">
Here, v1.27.4 is used as an example.
</div>

```bash
kubectl version
```

During installation, specify the scheduler image version according to your cluster server version (from the previous command). For example, for v1.27.4, use:

```bash
helm install hami hami-charts/hami \
  --set scheduler.kubeScheduler.imageTag=v1.27.4 \
  -n kube-system
  ```

If you see both **vgpu-device-plugin** and **vgpu-scheduler** Pods running via `kubectl get pods`, installation is successful.

```bash
root@iZj6c5dnq07p1ic04ei9vwZ:~# kubectl get pods -n kube-system|grep hami
hami-device-plugin-b6mvj                          2/2     Running   0          42s
hami-scheduler-7f5c5ff968-26kjc                   2/2     Running   0          42s
```

### Custom Configuration

> 📄 Official documentation: [HAMi-config.cn.md](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/blob/master/docs/config_cn.md)

You can customize parameters during installation using **-set**, for example:

```bash
helm install vgpu vgpu-charts/vgpu \
  --set devicePlugin.deviceMemoryScaling=5 \
  ...
  ```

- **devicePlugin.deviceSplitCount**: Integer, default 10. Number of splits per GPU; each GPU cannot allocate more than this number of tasks.
- **devicePlugin.deviceMemoryScaling**: Float, default 1. NVIDIA device memory usage ratio; can be >1 (enables virtual memory, experimental).
- **devicePlugin.migStrategy**: String, supports "none" and "mixed". "none" ignores MIG devices, "mixed" uses special resource names for MIG devices. Default: "none".
- **devicePlugin.disablecorelimit**: String, "true" disables core limit, "false" enables it. Default: "false".
- **scheduler.defaultMem**: Integer, default 5000 (MB). Default memory if not specified.
- **scheduler.defaultCores**: Integer (0-100), default 0. Default percent of GPU core reserved per task.
- **scheduler.defaultGPUNum**: Integer, default 1. If set to 0, config is ignored. If a Pod doesn't specify nvidia.com/gpu, webhook adds this default value.
- **resourceName**: String, resource name for vGPU count. Default: "nvidia.com/gpu"
- **resourceMem**: String, resource name for vGPU memory. Default: "nvidia.com/gpumem"
- **resourceMemPercentage**: String, resource name for vGPU memory percentage. Default: "nvidia.com/gpumem-percentage"
- **resourceCores**: String, resource name for vGPU core. Default: "nvidia.com/cores"
- **resourcePriority**: String, resource name for task priority. Default: "nvidia.com/priority"

There are also container-level configs:

- **GPU_CORE_UTILIZATION_POLICY**: String, "default", "force", "disable" for core limit policy.
- **ACTIVE_OOM_KILLER**: String, "true" or "false" for whether the container is killed on OOM.

For a simple demo, you can deploy with default settings.

## 4. Validation

### Check Node GPU Resources

Similar to the TimeSlicing solution, after installation, the Node shows increased GPU resources. With one physical GPU, HAMi by default expands it 10x, so you see 1*10 = 10 GPUs on the Node.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f0f0f0;">
Default split count is 10, configurable.
</div>

### Validate Memory and Core Limits

Use the following yaml to create a Pod. In addition to nvidia.com/gpu, resources.limit also includes nvidia.com/gpumem and nvidia.com/gpucores to specify memory and core limits.

- nvidia.com/gpu: Number of vGPUs requested, e.g. 1
- nvidia.com/gpumem: Requested memory, e.g. 3000M
- nvidia.com/gpumem-percentage: Memory percentage, e.g. 50 for 50% of GPU memory
- nvidia.com/priority: Priority, 0 is high, 1 is low, default is 1

High-priority tasks sharing a GPU node with other high-priority tasks are not limited by **resourceCores** and can use all available resources.

Similarly, low-priority tasks that exclusively use a GPU node are not limited by **resourceCores**.

Only when multiple tasks of different priorities run on the same GPU node does **resourceCores** take effect to ensure fairness and isolation.

Sample gpu-test.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-container
      image: ubuntu:18.04
      command: ["bash", "-c", "sleep 86400"]
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1          # Request 1 vGPU
          nvidia.com/gpumem: 3000    # Allocate 3000 MiB of GPU memory per vGPU (optional)
          nvidia.com/gpucores: 30    # Use 30% of the physical GPU's compute capacity per vGPU (optional)
```

Pod starts successfully:

```bash
root@iZj6c5dnq07p1ic04ei9vwZ:~# kubectl get po
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gpu-pod   1/1     Running   0          48s
```

Inside the Pod, run nvidia-smi to check GPU info. The displayed limit matches the 3000M requested in Resources.

```bash
root@iZj6c5dnq07p1ic04ei9vwZ:~# kubectl exec -it gpu-pod -- bash
root@gpu-pod:/# nvidia-smi

## 5. Summary

This article introduced the open-source vGPU solution HAMi and validated it with a simple demo.

**Why do we need GPU sharing and partitioning?**
With the default device plugin in k8s, GPU resources are mapped one-to-one to physical GPUs. Once a Pod requests a physical GPU, other Pods cannot use it.

To improve resource utilization, we need solutions for GPU sharing and partitioning.

**HAMi Implementation Principle**

By replacing the libvgpu.so library in the container, HAMi intercepts CUDA APIs to isolate and limit GPU core and memory usage.
