Pods don’t just “land on nodes”—GPU pods also land on  **GPUs** . Kubernetes today gives you solid **node-level** bin-packing/spreading (eg. `MostAllocated`, topology spread). But **GPU-level** bin-packing/spreading still requires a  **device-aware implementation** . Kubernetes 1.34’s **DRA** makes device *description and allocation* first-class and even bridges back to **extended resources** for a smooth migration path—but **generic device scoring** (the bit that would enable built-in GPU bin-pack/spread) is still in flight.

## Why “two axes”?

* **Node axis:**
  * **Binpack** (eg. `MostAllocated`, `RequestedToCapacityRatio`) helps consolidation and makes **Cluster Autoscaler** shrink easier → cost control.
  * **Spread** (Pod Topology Spread) improves **availability** and stabilizes tail-latency by avoiding single failure domains.
* **GPU axis:**
  * **Binpack** on devices squeezes small workloads onto fewer  **physical GPUs** , freeing **whole GPUs** for training or future bursts.
  * **Spread** on devices reduces **GPU-internal contention** (HBM/SM/PCIe/NVLink) and smooths **P99** for online inference.

The second axis (GPU) is where today’s “native” knobs are limited. Kubernetes **node** scoring doesn’t see *which* GPU a pod would use. DRA adds the structure for device allocation, but **device/node scoring for DRA** is a work-in-progress enhancement, and **NodeResourcesFit scoring does not apply** to *extended resources backed by DRA* (the migration bridge added in 1.34).

## What DRA solves (and doesn’t)

* **Solves:** A standardized model to **describe devices** (`ResourceSlice`), **declare requests** (`ResourceClaim`), and **categorize types** (`DeviceClass`). Kubernetes can allocate matching devices and place the pod on a node that can access them. In 1.34, **KEP-5004** lets a DeviceClass map DRA-managed devices to an **extended resource** name so existing manifests can keep using the classic `vendor.com/gpu: N` syntax during migration.
* **Doesn’t (yet):** A **generic scheduler scorer** for devices/nodes that would enable “built-in GPU bin-pack/spread.” The community opened issues to add a **`dynamicresources` scorer** for correct bin-packing; until that lands, device-level strategies come from drivers or external/device-aware schedulers. Also: **NodeResourcesFit scoring won’t work** for extended resources  **backed by DRA** .

## The 2×2 you can actually feel: Node × GPU = four patterns

Below I use a minimal, reproducible setup to show all four patterns. The point isn’t to sell any particular stack—it’s to **observe the trade-offs** you’ll likely see in production.

### One-click setup

All manifests and Terraform live here:

* Repo: `https://github.com/dynamia-ai/hami-ecosystem-demo`
* Demos: [`demo/binpack-spread`](https://github.com/dynamia-ai/hami-ecosystem-demo/tree/main/demo/binpack-spread) (four YAMLs = the four patterns). Each YAML is a minimal `Deployment`; only two knobs change:
  **Policies (two axes)** via annotations:

  ```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        hami.io/node-scheduler-policy: "binpack"  # or "spread"
        hami.io/gpu-scheduler-policy:  "binpack"  # or "spread"
  ```

  **GPU quotas** enforced by [HAMi](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi):

  ```yaml
  resources:
    limits:
      nvidia.com/gpu: 1
      nvidia.com/gpumem: "7500"  # ≈7.5GB cap so two pods can co-locate on one GPU
  ```

  Everything else (image/args) is identical across the four files.

Bring up the EKS environment:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/dynamia-ai/hami-ecosystem-demo>
cd hami-ecosystem-demo/infra/aws
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This creates two GPU nodes (one with  **4×T4** , one with  **4×A10G** ). If you prefer a step-by-step walkthrough with notes, see **“One-Click Setup”** in:

*Virtualizing Any GPU on AWS with HAMi: Free Memory Isolation* — Also on: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ncjzn0/virtualizing_any_gpu_on_aws_with_hami_free_memory/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@nimbus-nimo/virtualizing-any-gpu-on-aws-with-hami-free-memory-isolation-bbd3c598b9fa)

### A) Node **binpack** × GPU **binpack** — *“Cost-lean & keep whole GPUs free.”*

* **When:** Many small inference or batch jobs; you want autoscaler headroom and intact GPUs for training later.
* **Gains:** Fewer active nodes; higher chance of  **whole-GPU availability** .
* **Costs:** GPU-internal contention → **P99 risk** for latency-sensitive traffic.

Run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f demo/binpack-spread/a-node-binpack-gpu-binpack.yaml

{
  printf "POD\\tNODE\\tUUIDS\\n";
  kubectl get po -l app=demo-a -o json \\
  | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status.phase=="Running") | [.metadata.name,.spec.nodeName] | @tsv' \\
  | while IFS=$'\\t' read -r pod node; do
      uuids=$(kubectl exec "$pod" -c vllm -- nvidia-smi --query-gpu=uuid --format=csv,noheader | paste -sd, -);
      printf "%s\\t%s\\t%s\\n" "$pod" "$node" "$uuids";
    done;
} | column -t -s $'\\t'
```

Observed (example):

```
POD                                               NODE                                       UUIDS

```

> Single  **node** , and the pods were **packed onto the minimum number of GPUs** that could satisfy their per-GPU limits (2 GPUs here).

### B) Node **spread** × GPU **binpack** — *“HA across nodes, yet keep whole GPUs free.”*

* **When:** Multi-replica services that need **zone/node diversity** but also want small jobs squeezed on GPUs.
* **Gains:** HA +  **whole-GPU availability** .
* **Costs:** Harder to shrink the cluster.

```

> **Across nodes** , but  **packed to the same GPU per node** .

### C) Node **binpack** × GPU **spread** — *“Save some cost, protect tail-latency.”*

* **When:** Online inference; want reasonably good consolidation without piling onto the same GPU.
* **Gains:** Still consolidation at node level; **lower contention** across GPUs.
* **Costs:** Not as cheap as (A).

```

> **One node** , **spread across multiple GPUs** on that node.

### D) Node **spread** × GPU **spread** — *“Tail-latency first.”*

* **When:** Strict SLA (search, ads, chat) where **P99** dominates.
* **Gains:** Low interference on both axes.
* **Costs:** Highest cost; most fragmentation.

## Where DRA fits today (and tomorrow)

* **Today:** DRA standardizes *what* to allocate and  *where it can run* . If you also enable  **KEP-5004** , apps can keep requesting extended resources while the **driver + slices** do the real work underneath—useful for migrating off DevicePlugin.  **But** : the **native NodeResourcesFit scoring doesn’t apply** to extended resources  **backed by DRA** , and the **`dynamicresources` scorer** is tracked to add **proper bin-packing** for dynamic resources.
* **Tomorrow:** Once DRA’s **device/node scoring** lands, more of this can happen “in the core” (at least for generic cases). Device-aware implementations will still matter for **card-internal topology** (NUMA/NVLink) and policy nuance.
