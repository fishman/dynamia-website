In the last article, we analyzed the `hami-scheduler` workflow and understood how `hami-webhook` and `hami-scheduler` work together.

[HAMI vGPU Principle Analysis Part 3: hami-scheduler Workflow Analysis](https://dynamia.ai/blog/open-source-vgpu-hami-scheduler-analysis)

This is the fourth article in the HAMI principle analysis series, analyzing how `hami-scheduler` selects nodes during scheduling, i.e., how advanced scheduling strategies like Spread and Binpack are implemented.

In this article, we will address the final question: *How are advanced scheduling strategies like Spread and Binpack implemented?*

> The following analysis is based on HAMI v2.4.0.

Here again is the HAMI Webhook & Scheduler workflow summarized in the previous article:

![HAMi Webhook & Scheduler workflow diagram](/images/blog/gpu6/p2.jpg)

1. A user creates a Pod and requests vGPU resources in it.
2. The kube-apiserver, based on the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`, sends a request to the HAMI-Webhook.
3. The HAMI-Webhook inspects the Pod's `Resource` field. If it requests a vGPU resource managed by HAMI, it changes the Pod's `SchedulerName` to `hami-scheduler`, directing the Pod to be scheduled by `hami-scheduler`.
    * For privileged Pods, the Webhook skips processing.
    * For Pods using vGPU resources but with a specified `nodeName`, the Webhook rejects them.
4. The `hami-scheduler` then schedules the Pod. However, it uses the default `kube-scheduler` image from Kubernetes, so its basic scheduling logic is the same as the `default-scheduler`. The `kube-scheduler` is configured via `KubeSchedulerConfiguration` to call an Extender Scheduler plugin.
    * This Extender Scheduler is another container within the `hami-scheduler` Pod, which provides both the Webhook and Scheduler APIs.
    * When a Pod requests vGPU resources, the `kube-scheduler` calls the Extender Scheduler plugin via HTTP as configured, thus implementing custom scheduling logic.
5. The Extender Scheduler plugin contains the actual HAMI scheduling logic. It scores nodes based on their remaining resources to select a node.
6. Asynchronous tasks, including GPU perception logic:
    * A background Goroutine in the devicePlugin periodically reports GPU resources on the Node and writes them to the Node's Annotations.
    * The Extender Scheduler plugin parses the total GPU resources from Node annotations and the used GPU resources from the annotations of running Pods on the Node. It then calculates the remaining available resources for each Node and stores them in memory for scheduling.

## 1. Configuring Scheduling Policies

`hami-scheduler` provides two different levels of scheduling policies:

* **Node Scheduling Policy**: Affects how a node is selected for a Pod during the scheduling process.
* **GPU Scheduling Policy**: Affects how a GPU is selected for a Pod after a node with multiple GPUs has been chosen.

According to the deployment documentation, we can specify the scheduling policies during deployment:

* `scheduler.defaultSchedulerPolicy.nodeSchedulerPolicy`: String type, with a preset value of "binpack", representing the GPU node scheduling policy. ***("binpack" means to try to assign tasks to the same GPU node as much as possible; "spread" means to try to assign tasks to different GPU nodes.)***
* `scheduler.defaultSchedulerPolicy.gpuSchedulerPolicy`: String type, with a preset value of "spread", representing the GPU scheduling policy. ***("binpack" means to try to assign tasks to the same GPU as much as possible; "spread" means to try to assign tasks to different GPUs.)***

Like this:

```bash
helm install vgpu vgpu-charts/vgpu \
  --set scheduler.defaultSchedulerPolicy.nodeSchedulerPolicy=binpack \
  --set scheduler.defaultSchedulerPolicy.gpuSchedulerPolicy=spread
```

After deployment, these two configurations apply to the `hami-scheduler` as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: vgpu-hami-scheduler
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - scheduler
        # ... other args
        - --node-scheduler-policy=binpack
        - --gpu-scheduler-policy=spread
```

It's these two parameters:

```yaml
- --node-scheduler-policy=binpack
- --gpu-scheduler-policy=spread
```

## 2. Node Scheduling Strategy Principle

This part is relatively simple. The logic for selecting a node is within the `Filter` interface.

```go
// pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go#L444
func (s *Scheduler) Filter(args extenderv1.ExtenderArgs) (*extenderv1.ExtenderFilterResult, error) {
    klog.InfoS("begin schedule filter", "pod", args.Pod.Name, "uuid", args.Pod.UID, "namespaces", args.Pod.Namespace)
    
    // ... logic to check if pod requests resources ...

    nodeUsage, failedNodes, err := s.getNodesUsage(args.NodeNames, args.Pod)
    // ... handle errors ...

    nodeScores, err := s.calcScore(nodeUsage, nums, annos, args.Pod)
    // ... handle errors ...

    if len((*nodeScores).NodeList) == 0 {
        // ... handle no suitable nodes ...
    }

    sort.Sort(nodeScores)
    m := (*nodeScores).NodeList[len((*nodeScores).NodeList)-1]
    klog.Infof("schedule %v/%v to %v %v", args.Pod.Namespace, args.Pod.Name, m.NodeID, m.Devices)
    
    // ... patch pod annotations ...
    
    res := extenderv1.ExtenderFilterResult{NodeNames: &[]string{m.NodeID}}
    return &res, nil
}
```

The main part is these few lines:

```go
// Calculate scores and get all suitable nodes
nodeScores, err := s.calcScore(nodeUsage, nums, annos, args.Pod)

// Sort
sort.Sort(nodeScores)
// Directly select the last node
m := (*nodeScores).NodeList[len((*nodeScores).NodeList)-1]

// Return the result
res := extenderv1.ExtenderFilterResult{NodeNames: &[]string{m.NodeID}}
return &res, nil```

This can be divided into two parts:
-   Calculate scores for all nodes.
-   Select the most suitable node based on the scheduling policy.

### Calculating Scores

The score calculation logic is in the `calcScore` method:

```go
// pkg/scheduler/score.go#L185
func (s *Scheduler) calcScore(nodes *map[string]*NodeUsage, nums util.PodDeviceRequests, annos map[string]string, task *corev1.Pod) (*policy.NodeScoreList, error) {
    // ... get policy from config or pod annotations ...
    
    for nodeID, node := range *nodes {
        score := policy.NodeScore{NodeID: nodeID, Devices: make(util.PodDevices), Score: 0}
        score.ComputeScore(node.Devices)
        
        // ... filter logic (fitInDevices) ...
        
        if ctrfit {
            res.NodeList = append(res.NodeList, &score)
        }
    }
    return &res, nil
}
```

The specific algorithm is in `ComputeScore`:

```go
// pkg/scheduler/policy/node_policy.go#L53
func (ns *NodeScore) ComputeScore(devices DeviceUsageList) {
    // current user having request resource
    used, usedCore, usedMem := int32(0), int32(0), int32(0)
    for _, device := range devices.DeviceLists {
        used += device.Device.Used
        usedCore += device.Device.Usedcores
        usedMem += device.Device.Usedmem
    }
    klog.V(2).Infof("node %s used %d, usedCore %d, usedMem %d,", ns.NodeID, used, usedCore, usedMem)

    total, totalCore, totalMem := int32(0), int32(0), int32(0)
    for _, deviceLists := range devices.DeviceLists {
        total += deviceLists.Device.Count
        totalCore += deviceLists.Device.Totalcore
        totalMem += deviceLists.Device.Totalmem
    }
    useScore := float32(used) / float32(total)
    coreScore := float32(usedCore) / float32(totalCore)
    memScore := float32(usedMem) / float32(totalMem)
    ns.Score = float32(Weight) * (useScore + coreScore + memScore)
    klog.V(2).Infof("node %s computer score is %f", ns.NodeID, ns.Score)
}
```

The scoring logic is based on the ratio of used GPU Core and GPU Memory to the total GPU Core and GPU Memory on each node, normalized by weights to get a final score.

In general: **the less remaining GPU Core and GPU Memory on a node, the higher its score.**

At first glance, this logic seems a bit counter-intuitive. Shouldn't more resources result in a higher score?

No problem, it will become clear after we look at the "Selecting a Node based on Policy" section.

### Filtering Nodes

After scoring, nodes that do not meet the conditions need to be filtered out based on the Pod's requested GPU information.

For example: if a Pod requests 2 vGPUs and a Node has only one card, it's definitely not feasible.

#### Parsing Pod's Requested GPU Information

First, the requested GPU information is parsed from the Pod info:

```go
// pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go#L444
func (s *Scheduler) Filter(args extenderv1.ExtenderArgs) (*extenderv1.ExtenderFilterResult, error) {
    nums := k8sutil.Resourcereqs(args.Pod)
}
```

The `Resourcereqs` content is as follows, which is relatively straightforward: it parses the requested gpu, gpucore, gpumem, etc., from the container's `Resources` based on the name.

#### Filtering Logic

The filtering logic is also in the `calcScore` method:

```go
ctrfit := false
for ctrid, n := range nums {
    // ...
    klog.V(5).InfoS("fitInDevices", "pod", klog.KObj(task), "node", nodeID)
    fit, _ := fitInDevices(node, n, annos, task, &score.Devices)
    ctrfit = fit
    if !fit {
        klog.InfoS("calcScore:node not fit pod", "pod", klog.KObj(task), "node", nodeID)
        break
    }
}

if ctrfit {
    res.NodeList = append(res.NodeList, &score)
}
```

The specific filtering rule is here: `fitInDevices`. If all conditions are met, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`, indicating the node is not schedulable.

This way, we have filtered out the unsuitable nodes. The remaining nodes can all schedule the Pod, but which one is chosen depends on the configured scheduling policy.

### Selecting a Node based on Policy

After calculating the score for each node, a selection can be made based on the policy.

```go
// Calculate scores and get all suitable nodes
nodeScores, err := s.calcScore(nodeUsage, nums, annos, args.Pod)

// Sort
sort.Sort(nodeScores)
// Directly select the last node
m := (*nodeScores).NodeList[len((*nodeScores).NodeList)-1]

// Return the result
res := extenderv1.ExtenderFilterResult{NodeNames: &[]string{m.NodeID}}
return &res, nil
```

The specific selection logic is here:

```go
// Sort
sort.Sort(nodeScores)
// Directly select the last node
m := (*nodeScores).NodeList[len((*nodeScores).NodeList)-1]
```

After sorting the score data, it directly selects the last node.

I was a bit confused when I first saw this, not understanding how it was related to the scheduling policy.

**The actual logic is in the `sort` here.** `NodeScoreList` must implement the `sort` interface to be sorted, so let's see how it's implemented:

```go
// pkg/scheduler/policy/node_policy.go#L32
type NodeScoreList struct {
    NodeList []*NodeScore
    Policy   string
}

// ... Len() and Swap() methods ...

func (l NodeScoreList) Less(i, j int) bool {
    if l.Policy == NodeSchedulerPolicySpread.String() {
        return l.NodeList[i].Score > l.NodeList[j].Score
    }
    // default policy is Binpack
    return l.NodeList[i].Score < l.NodeList[j].Score
}
```

The core part:

```go
func (l NodeScoreList) Less(i, j int) bool {
    if l.Policy == NodeSchedulerPolicySpread.String() {
        return l.NodeList[i].Score > l.NodeList[j].Score
    }
    // default policy is Binpack
    return l.NodeList[i].Score < l.NodeList[j].Score
}
```

Depending on our `Policy`, there are two sorting methods, and they are exactly opposite.

This involves the implementation of `sort.Sort()`. Simply put:

* If the `Less()` method uses a greater than (`>`) comparison, the final sorting result will be in descending order.
* If the `Less()` method uses a less than (`<`) comparison, the final sorting result will be in ascending order.

Corresponding to the scheduling policies:

* **Binpack policy** uses a less than (`<`) comparison, resulting in an ascending sort.
* **Spread policy** uses a greater than (`>`) comparison, resulting in a descending sort.

And since the scoring rule was: **the fewer remaining resources, the higher the score,** and we **select the last node after sorting.**

At this point, the logic is clear.

* The **Binpack** policy selects the last node. Because of the ascending sort, the last Node has the highest score, meaning it has the **least** free resources.
* The **Spread** policy selects the last node. Because of the descending sort, the last Node has the lowest score, meaning it has the **most** free resources.

This perfectly matches the original meaning of the policies:

* **Binpack** tries to schedule all Pods to the same node, filling up one node's resources before using others.
* **Spread** is the opposite, trying to distribute Pods across all nodes.

### Where does the scheduling policy come from?

This logic is actually in the `calScore` method, which first uses a default policy (overridden by command-line flags) and then checks the Pod's annotations for `hami.io/node-scheduler-policy` to override it.

With this, the Node scheduling policy analysis is complete.

---

## 3. GPU Scheduling Strategy Principle

Once a Node is selected, if it has multiple GPUs, which one should the Pod be allocated to? This is where the GPU scheduling policy comes into effect.

The logic for selecting a GPU is also implicitly in the `Filter` method, specifically within `fitInDevices`.

### Filtering GPUs

The logic here is hidden quite deeply, in the `fitInDevices` method.

```go
// pkg/scheduler/score.go#L144
func fitInDevices(node *NodeUsage, requests util.ContainerDeviceRequests, annos map[string]string, pod *corev1.Pod, devinput *util.PodDevices) (bool, float32) {
    // ...
    for _, k := range requests {
        sort.Sort(node.Devices)
        fit, tmpDevs := fitInCertainDevice(node, k, annos, pod)
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

The core part:

```go
for _, k := range requests {
    sort.Sort(node.Devices)
    fit, tmpDevs := fitInCertainDevice(node, k, annos, pod)
    if fit {
        devs = append(devs, tmpDevs[k.Type]...)
    } else {
        return false, 0
    }
    (*devinput)[k.Type] = append((*devinput)[k.Type], devs)
}
```

The `sort.Sort` appears again. Does this look familiar? Let's check the `Sort` interface implementation for GPUs:

```go
// ... Len() and Swap() methods ...

func (l DeviceUsageList) Less(i, j int) bool {
    if l.Policy == GPUSchedulerPolicyBinpack.String() {
        if l.DeviceLists[i].Device.Numa == l.DeviceLists[j].Device.Numa {
            return l.DeviceLists[i].Score < l.DeviceLists[j].Score
        }
        return l.DeviceLists[i].Device.Numa > l.DeviceLists[j].Device.Numa
    }
    // default policy is spread
    if l.DeviceLists[i].Device.Numa == l.DeviceLists[j].Device.Numa {
        return l.DeviceLists[i].Score > l.DeviceLists[j].Score
    }
    return l.DeviceLists[i].Device.Numa < l.DeviceLists[j].Device.Numa
}
```

As expected, it's the same pattern. The `Less` method returns different results based on the GPU scheduling policy to control whether the sort is ascending or descending.

### Selecting a GPU

Then the subsequent code for selecting a GPU is as follows, in `fitInCertainDevice`:

```go
func fitInCertainDevice(...) (bool, map[string]util.ContainerDevices) {
    // ...
    for i := len(node.Devices.DeviceLists) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        // ... filtering conditions ...
        
        if k.Nums > 0 {
            k.Nums--
            tmpDevs[k.Type] = append(tmpDevs[k.Type], util.ContainerDevice{
                // ... populate device info ...
            })
        }
        if k.Nums == 0 {
            return true, tmpDevs
        }
    }
    return false, tmpDevs
}
```

The core is this `for` loop:

```go
for i := len(node.Devices.DeviceLists) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
}
```

It also starts from the last GPU. This means if a GPU at the end of the list meets the conditions, it will be selected directly, and it won't check the ones before it.

* **Binpack policy**: The result is in ascending order, so the GPUs further back have **fewer** free resources.
* **Spread policy**: The result is in descending order, so the GPUs further back have **more** free resources.

This also aligns with the meaning of the respective policies.

With this, the GPU scheduling policy analysis is complete.

### How the DevicePlugin Parses GPU Info

During scheduling, we recorded the chosen GPU in the Pod's Annotations. The DevicePlugin doesn't need to select a GPU; it can just parse it from the Annotations.
The logic in `GetNextDeviceRequest` and `DecodePodDevices` handles reading the `hami.io/vgpu-devices-to-allocate` annotation and parsing the comma- and colon-separated string to get the device details.

At this point, the analysis of HAMI's Node and GPU level Spread and Binpack advanced scheduling strategies is complete.

## 4. Summary

### Scheduling Policy Configuration

`hami-scheduler` provides two different levels of scheduling policies:

* **Node Scheduling Policy**: Affects how a node is selected for a Pod.
* **GPU Scheduling Policy**: Affects how a GPU is selected for a Pod on a multi-GPU node.

Both support `Spread` and `Binpack` configurations:

* `Spread` tries to distribute tasks across different Nodes or GPUs to keep the load level similar across the cluster's Nodes or GPUs.
* `Binpack` tries to assign tasks to the same Node or GPU, filling one up before using another.

### Specific Node and GPU Scheduling Strategy Implementation

The implementation for both can be broken down into these steps:

1. **Scoring Nodes/GPUs**: Score is calculated based on resource utilization.
2. **Filtering**: Unsuitable Nodes/GPUs are filtered out.
3. **Selecting**: The best Node/GPU is selected based on the scheduling policy.
    * The core logic is implemented in the `Less` method of the `sort.Sort` interface.
    * For the `Spread` policy, it selects the Node/GPU with more remaining resources. For the `Binpack` policy, it selects the one with fewer remaining resources.
4. **Recording the Result**:
    * For a **Node**, the result is finalized by binding the Pod to it.
    * For a **GPU**, the choice is recorded in the Pod's Annotations for the DevicePlugin to use.
