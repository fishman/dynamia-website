## 00 Preface

🚀 Say goodbye to GPU-resource headaches—HAMi puts you in control of heterogeneous clusters.

Are you facing any of these challenges?

* **Low GPU utilization**: Expensive GPUs are often idle, making ROI hard to achieve.
* **Heterogeneous-device chaos**: NVIDIA, Ascend, and other accelerators in the same cluster are tricky to manage.
* **Resource black box**: You can’t see real-time allocation and usage, so optimization feels impossible.

HAMi is purpose-built to solve these pain points. It specializes in GPU sharing & isolation, natively supports heterogeneous devices including NVIDIA and Ascend, and pairs with the HAM-WebUI visual console to boost utilization, simplify operations, and make resource usage transparent.

To help you grasp HAMi’s core value and day-to-day usage, we created this article—“9 Key Questions Every New User Must Know.” Let’s clear common hurdles and tackle heterogeneous AI compute like pros.

## 01 FAQ

### Q1: Which hardware partners does HAMi support?

### Q2: What is a vGPU? Why can’t I “multi-open” on one card even though I see 10 vGPUs?

In short:

* A **vGPU** is *not* a virtual graphics card; it is a *virtual view* of the physical card.
* Setting `deviceSplitCount: 10` means **one physical GPU can be seen & shared by at most 10 tasks**, **not** that one task can request multiple vGPUs on the same card.

Detailed explanation:

* All vGPUs share the same underlying physical resources; they are logical views, not independent partitions.
* When you request `nvidia.com/gpu: 2`, the scheduler interprets this as “give me two physical GPUs,” **not** two vGPUs on the same card.
* The allocation model is designed for **multi-task sharing** of one card, **not** single-task replication of views.
* Inside the container, the GPU UUID matches the physical node, confirming that vGPUs are logical over-commitment views.

Bottom line: vGPU over-commitment boosts overall utilization by letting more tasks share one card, rather than increasing an individual task’s resources.

### Q3: Which open-source schedulers can HAMi integrate with?

**Currently supported:**

* **Volcano** – Use the `volcano-vgpu-device-plugin` maintained by the HAMi project to enable GPU-aware batch scheduling.

**Currently NOT supported:**

* **KubeVirt & Kata Containers** – Both rely on virtualization (PCI passthrough or Virtio) for isolation. HAMi’s device plugin requires direct device mounting into containers, making architectural integration non-trivial. For performance and complexity reasons, we focus on bare-metal / container runtimes for now.

### Q4: Does HAMi support multi-node, multi-GPU distributed training? Cross-node & cross-GPU?

Absolutely.

* **Multi-node, multi-GPU**: K8s schedules multiple Pods across nodes. Each Pod uses its local GPUs, while distributed frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Horovod, etc.) handle cross-node & cross-GPU coordination.
* **Cross-node**: Pods on different nodes communicate via high-performance networks (NCCL, RDMA) to exchange gradients and parameters.
* **Cross-GPU**: A single Pod can request multiple GPUs on the same node for intra-node parallelism.

**Not supported:**

* **Single Pod spanning multiple nodes** – K8s design forbids this; HAMi does not implement remote GPU invocation. Use the multi-Pod distributed pattern instead.

### Q5: Can GPU resources be changed on the fly? Does HAMi support dynamic adjustment?

**Not yet.** True dynamic adjustment is **unsupported**.

Rationale:

* **Container-level limitation**: GPU resources are static at Pod creation.
* **K8s design**: Declarative, predictable resource management is a core principle.
* **DRA misconception**: DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) helps K8s understand complex device parameters—it does **not** enable live resource resizing.

Future outlook:

* If “runtime limits on compute & memory” become a strong demand, HAMi may explore program-level throttling.
* Native dynamic GPU resizing remains a long-term community goal.

### Q6: Why are there so many device plugins? Some from vendors, some from HAMi?

**Why some domestic vendors ship without a separate runtime:**

* **All-in-one approach**: Cambricon, Hygon, Enflame, etc., embed device discovery & mounting inside their device plugin, eliminating the need for an extra runtime component.
* **NVIDIA & Ascend prefer separation**: Device plugin handles resource reporting; runtime (NVIDIA Container Runtime or Ascend Docker Runtime) handles environment setup, mount points, and advanced features—cleaner modularity.

**Why HAMi sometimes re-implements device plugins:**

* **Official plugins lack metadata** needed for advanced features (NUMA awareness, compute/memory caps, over-commit).
* **Simpler scheduler integration**: Custom plugins expose richer, purpose-built APIs.

Examples:

* **Ascend**: Each card type required its own plugin; HAMi abstracts card-type templates into one plugin.
* **NVIDIA**: Limited resource info; HAMi re-implements to expose compute, memory, and topology data.

### Q7: vGPU split count not working? Compute/memory limits ignored? How to debug?

* **Split count ignored** – Check for conflicting NVIDIA official device plugin or incorrect `devicePlugin.deviceSplitCount`.
* **Compute not limited** – Add `GPU_CORE_UTILIZATION_POLICY=force`; otherwise a single container on the card runs unrestricted.
* **Memory not limited** – Privileged mode or `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` inside the container overrides limits.
* **Recommendation**: Audit plugin conflicts, verify environment variables.

⚠️ Compute-limit note: A 50 % limit means *long-term average* usage will be ~50 %; instantaneous spikes above that are possible.

### Q8: Why does `nvidia-smi` inside a GPU Pod show no processes?

PID namespace isolation hides host PIDs. To see GPU processes, set `hostPID=true` (security trade-off—use with caution).

### Q9: What’s on HAMi’s roadmap? Next-gen feature preview

HAMi is continuously evolving. Key directions:

**Core technology**

* **Full DRA migration** – Develop HAMi DRA driver; migrate GPU virtualization & scheduling logic to K8s-native DRA framework.

**WebUI overhaul**

* **i18n & dark mode**
* **Better abstraction** for Ascend and other accelerators, lowering onboarding cost.
* **Richer metrics** with iframe embedding support.

**Feature extensions** (subject to release planning):

* **Granular scheduling knobs**: node/ GPU compact vs. spread, node over-commit ratio, device-mode filters (hami-core, MIG, MPS).
* **VM monitoring & governance** – Track VMs as external nodes via special labels.
* **Multi-cluster unified dashboard** – Cross-cluster resource overview.
* **YAML wizard** – WebUI form to generate annotated K8s manifests in one click.
