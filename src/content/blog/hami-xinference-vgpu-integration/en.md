## Key Highlights

* **Xinference** is Xorbits' open-source multi-model inference platform (LLM/Embedding/Image/Audio/TTS/Rerank, etc.), featuring a **Supervisor/Worker** architecture and providing **OpenAI-compatible APIs**, making it easy to replace and integrate with existing applications.
* In enterprise deployments, Xinference **does not provide compute isolation itself**, leading to waste from "small models monopolizing entire cards" and gaps in quota and observability for multi-tenant scenarios.
* The newly merged **Helm PR #6** provides native support for **HAMi vGPU** in the Chart: with simple parameter switches, you can pass resources like `nvidia.com/gpucores` and `nvidia.com/gpumem-percentage` to **Supervisor/Worker**, enabling secure GPU sharing, improved utilization, and unified quota and monitoring.

## What is Xinference: User-Friendly Interface, Versatile Formats, Distributed and Scalable

* **Multi-Model Capabilities**: Supports chat/generation, Embedding, Vision, Images, Audio (ASR/TTS/voice conversion/cloning), Rerank, and common engines (vLLM, Transformers, llama.cpp, SGLang, MLX).
* **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Seamlessly switch existing calls to local or self-hosted clusters.
* **Supervisor/Worker Architecture**: Supervisor handles coordination and management, while Workers handle actual execution and use CPU/GPU resources; in distributed scenarios, multiple Workers connect to the same Supervisor.
* **Performance Enhancements**: Supports continuous batching and provides the **Xavier** mechanism for sharing KV Cache across multiple vLLM instances, reducing redundant prefix computation overhead.

## Why Integrate with HAMi: From "Can Run" to "Shareable, Measurable, Governable"

In enterprise production, two common problems arise:

1. **Lightweight models monopolizing entire cards** → causing significant waste;
2. **Lack of multi-tenant governance** → difficulty in applying fine-grained quotas and observability across different teams/tasks.

**HAMi vGPU** addresses these shortcomings:

* Use **percentage/capacity** to limit the **GPU cores and memory** available to a single task (e.g., `nvidia.com/gpucores`, `nvidia.com/gpumem-percentage`), safely splitting one card for multiple tasks to share.
* After integration, **scheduling/quota/observability** all work through the Kubernetes system, facilitating unified management.

## One-Click Enablement: Native HAMi vGPU Support in Helm

PR #6 has been merged into the official Helm Charts. Enabling vGPU only requires turning on switches in the values (Supervisor/Worker can be enabled separately).

The example below focuses on "allocating vGPU only to Workers" (more aligned with common practice):

```yaml
# values.yaml (excerpt)
xinferenceWorker:
  worker:
    vgpu:
      enabled: true
    resources:
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        nvidia.com/gpucores: 20            # Use 20% GPU cores
        nvidia.com/gpumem-percentage: 10   # Use 10% memory
      requests:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "8Gi"

xinferenceSupervisor:
  supervisor:
    vgpu:
      enabled: false                       # Generally doesn't need GPU, change to true if needed
```

Helm installation:

```bash
helm repo add xinference https://xorbitsai.github.io/xinference-helm-charts
helm repo update

# Prepare values.yaml as shown in the example above
helm install xinference xinference/xinference -n xinference -f values.yaml
```

## Verified Small Model Concurrency: Running 5 Qwen3-0.6B on a Single L4

In the PR comments, the contributor provided a **tested example**:

![Multi-Model Demo](/images/blog/hami-xinference-vgpu/multi-model-demo.png)

On an **NVIDIA L4 (24 GB)**, HAMi was used to split the memory into multiple portions, allocating approximately **2GB** of memory to each of 5 Workers, thereby supporting **5 Qwen3-0.6B** model inference processes simultaneously, verifying the feasibility of "safely sharing an entire card with small models."

> This scenario is particularly suitable for: Embedding/Rerank/small audio/lightweight Agent tool models—high concurrency but low per-model consumption.

## Monitoring and Multi-Tenant Governance

* **Xinference-side metrics**: Supervisor/Worker expose independent metric dashboards for observing model count, request throughput, latency, etc.
* **HAMi-side observability/quotas**: Through Kubernetes native resources and HAMi's vGPU metrics, combined with namespace-quota policies, build hierarchical "project-task" governance.

## Conclusion and Acknowledgments

Combining Xinference's "multi-model ease-of-use + OpenAI compatibility" with HAMi's "fine-grained vGPU quotas + unified governance" enables shifting GPUs **from exclusive to shared** and capabilities **from runnable to manageable**, all **without changing business code**.
