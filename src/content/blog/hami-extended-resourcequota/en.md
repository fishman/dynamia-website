In HAMi v2.7.0, the community introduced an **extended ResourceQuota** mechanism to address the limitations of native Kubernetes `ResourceQuota` in GPU and heterogeneous computing scenarios. This feature aims to solve two major pain points that native quota management cannot handle: "resource correlation" and "dynamic resources," providing more precise and reliable control capabilities for GPU resource governance in multi-tenant environments.

Building on the feature introduction, this article dives deep into the code implementation, providing a detailed analysis of the specific design and implementation principles of HAMi's extended ResourceQuota.

## Core Pain Points: Two Major Limitations of Native ResourceQuota

### 1. Cannot Understand Resource Correlation

Native `ResourceQuota` calculates each resource independently and cannot understand their internal relationships. For example, when a Pod requests 2 GPUs with 2000MB memory each (`nvidia.com/gpu: 2`, `nvidia.com/gpumem: 2000`), native Quota incorrectly records the total memory requirement as `2000MB` instead of the correct `2 * 2000MB = 4000MB`. This leads to seriously distorted quota management.

### 2. Cannot Handle Dynamic Resources

For memory requests specified as percentages (e.g., `gpumem-percentage: 50`), the actual memory consumption can **only be calculated after the scheduling decision is complete** (i.e., when the specific physical GPU to be allocated is determined). Native `ResourceQuota` performs checks before scheduling and cannot handle such dynamic resource values that require "schedule first, deduct later."

## Solution: Enhanced ResourceQuota

HAMi's solution does not replace or rewrite native `ResourceQuota`, but rather builds a **lightweight, non-intrusive** enhancement layer on top of it in the HAMi scheduler. The core working principle is: the HAMi scheduler monitors standard `ResourceQuota` objects, and when it discovers resources managed by HAMi with the `limits.` prefix (e.g., `limits.nvidia.com/gpumem`), it performs quota checks on these resources within its own scheduling cycle, thereby applying its more refined calculation rules.

## Implementation Principles: Deep Code Analysis

HAMi's handling of extended ResourceQuota is divided into two core stages: "Quota Synchronization" and "Scheduling-Time Checks."

### 1. Stage 1: Quota Synchronization - Listening and Caching

The goal of this stage is to synchronize `ResourceQuota` objects with the `limits.` prefix from the K8s cluster into a local cache maintained by the HAMi scheduler itself.

#### Listening and Recognition

The HAMi scheduler listens to add/delete/update events of `ResourceQuota` objects in the cluster through the Informer mechanism. When events occur, event handlers like `onAddQuota` are triggered.

#### Prefix Filtering and Caching

In the `AddQuota` function, the code iterates through all resource items defined in the `ResourceQuota` object's `spec.hard`. Only resource items with the `limits.` prefix are recognized and processed. Subsequently, the resource name is stripped of its prefix and, along with its limit value, is stored in a global `QuotaManager` cache.

The core implementation is located in `pkg/device/quota.go`:

```go
// File: pkg/device/quota.go

// AddQuota synchronizes extended resources from K8s ResourceQuota objects to local cache
func (q *QuotaManager) AddQuota(quota *corev1.ResourceQuota) {
        q.mutex.Lock()
        defer q.mutex.Unlock()

        for idx, val := range quota.Spec.Hard {
                value, ok := val.AsInt64()
                if ok {
                        // 1. Check for "limits." prefix
                        if !strings.HasPrefix(idx.String(), "limits.") {
                                continue
                        }
                        // 2. Strip prefix to get the real resource name
                        dn := strings.TrimPrefix(idx.String(), "limits.")
                        if !IsManagedQuota(dn) { // Check if it's a resource type managed by HAMi
                                continue
                        }
                        // ...
                        // 3. Write resource and its Limit value to local cache
                        (*dp)[dn].Limit = value
                        // ...
                }
        }
}
```

### 2. Stage 2: Scheduling-Time Checks - Iterative Per-Card Verification

This is the core of HAMi's extended `ResourceQuota` implementation of its intelligent calculation capabilities. When a Pod enters the scheduling process, its quota check is not a one-time "total amount" calculation, but is completed in the device-side `Fit()` function in a **loop-iterative, per-card verification** manner, accompanying the process of finding suitable physical cards for the Pod.

The decision flow is illustrated in the following diagram:

![Quota Check Flow](/images/blog/hami-extended-resourcequota/quota-check-flow-en.png)

This process solves the two major challenges of "resource correlation" and "dynamic resources" through the following methods:

#### Dynamic Resource Calculation

Inside the `Fit()` function's loop, when checking each specific physical card, the code calculates the specific numerical value that the Pod's dynamic resource request (such as percentage-based memory) should be converted to, based on that card's **actual hardware specifications** (e.g., `dev.Totalmem`).

#### Resource Correlation Calculation

The `fitQuota` function, when checking, considers the sum of **cards already selected for allocation within the current Pod** (`tmpDevs`) and **the new card being attempted for allocation**. This ensures that when a Pod requests multiple devices, its correlated resources (such as total memory) are calculated cumulatively.

The core implementation is located in `pkg/device/nvidia/device.go`:

```go
// File: pkg/device/nvidia/device.go

// Fit function (simplified logic)
func (nv *NvidiaGPUDevices) Fit(...) (bool, map[string]device.ContainerDevices, string) {
        // ...
        // Loop through all available GPU devices on the node
        for i := len(devices) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
                dev := devices[i]
                memreq := int32(0)
                // 1. Dynamic resource calculation:
                //    If percentage-based memory is requested, calculate based on the current dev card's actual total memory
                if k.MemPercentagereq != 101 && k.Memreq == 0 {
                        memreq = dev.Totalmem * k.MemPercentagereq / 100
                }
                // 2. Correlated resource check (call fitQuota):
                //    Check if "resources already allocated for this Pod + resources of the current card" exceed quota
                if !fitQuota(tmpDevs, pod.Namespace, int64(memreq), int64(k.Coresreq)) {
                        continue // Insufficient quota, skip this card
                }
                // ... (other checks) ...
                // If checks pass, add this card to the allocation list tmpDevs
                tmpDevs[k.Type] = append(tmpDevs[k.Type], ...)
                if k.Nums == 0 {
                        return true, tmpDevs, "" // Satisfied Pod's requested card count, allocation successful
                }
        }
        // ...
}

// fitQuota handles the core quota check logic
func fitQuota(tmpDevs map[string]device.ContainerDevices, ns string, memreq int64, coresreq int64) bool {
        mem := memreq
        core := coresreq
        // Accumulate resources in the allocation list
        for _, val := range tmpDevs[NvidiaGPUDevice] {
                mem += int64(val.Usedmem)
                core += int64(val.Usedcores)
        }
        // Call QuotaManager's cache for final check
        return device.GetLocalCache().FitQuota(ns, mem, core, NvidiaGPUDevice)
}
```

### 3. Behavioral Differences and Implementation Notes

It should be noted that HAMi's extended `ResourceQuota` mechanism has two key differences from native `ResourceQuota` in terms of implementation and behavior:

#### Independent Internal State

HAMi's quota calculation (e.g., `2 * 2000MB = 4000MB`) and usage statistics are entirely performed in the `QuotaManager` cache internal to its scheduler, and **are not written back to the `status` field of the native Kubernetes `ResourceQuota` object**. This means that the `used` field viewed through `kubectl describe resourcequota` cannot reflect the actual usage of extended resources managed by HAMi.

#### Scheduling Failure Behavior

When a Pod's resource request exceeds the quota managed by HAMi, its behavior differs from native `ResourceQuota`. Under the native mechanism, over-quota Pods are **directly rejected** by the API Server at creation time. Under HAMi's mechanism, the Pod object is successfully created, but is judged as unschedulable by the HAMi scheduler, keeping it **in a `Pending` state** until the quota is released or adjusted.

## Usage

Users only need to add the `limits.` prefix to resource names they wish HAMi to manage with fine-grained control in the standard `ResourceQuota` object.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: gpu-quota
  namespace: default
spec:
  hard:
    limits.nvidia.com/gpu: "2"
    limits.nvidia.com/gpumem: "4000"
```

## Summary

HAMi's extended `ResourceQuota` design does not modify the native controller, but extends functionality through independent check logic implemented in the HAMi scheduler. Its core is to calculate **dynamic resources** and perform **cumulative verification** for each candidate device when screening physical devices for Pods, solving the problem of native mechanisms being unable to handle dynamic and correlated resources.
